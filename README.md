# ðŸ§¬ Virulence Factor Prediction using Deep Learning ðŸ§¬
## Project Overview
Welcome to our project where we harness the power of Deep Learning and Pre-trained Protein Language Models to predict potential virulence factors. By analyzing protein sequences, our model identifies proteins that may possess toxic functions, which is crucial for biomedical research and drug development.

### Features
Deep Learning Techniques: Utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to enhance prediction accuracy.

Pre-trained Protein Language Models: Leveraging pre-trained models to understand the language of proteins and make informed predictions.

User-Friendly: Designed to be accessible with minimal setup required.

## Getting Started
To get started with our virulence factor prediction tool, you'll need a PC equipped with a GPU and Python installed. Follow these simple steps:

### Clone the Repository:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/niuwa2333/DTVF.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory:
''' bash
cd DTVF
'''

### Run the UI Script:
''' bash
python run.py 
'''

## Data
We've included the training and testing datasets in the repository, pre-processed as .h5 format embeddings, to facilitate easy access and usage.
